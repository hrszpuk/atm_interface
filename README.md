## atm_interface
A very basic interface that tries to have the same functionality that an ATM could have (maybe slightly different).
This is just a test project, at the time of this project I am still learning Rust. You may download and use the program, though it should be noted: the program has no practical use, and is really only for educational purposes.

### Installation
You can install `atm_interface` with a few simple steps.
To begin with, clone the repository using the method shown below:
``` 
git clone git@github.com:hrszpuk/atm_interface.git
```
After doing so you can change directory into the project and built using `cargo` **(which is required)**.
``` 
cd atm_interface && cargo build --release
```
Finally, change into the target directory and run the program using `./atm_interface`:
``` 
cd target/release && ./atm_interface
```
From here, you can use the "help" command to see a list of command you can use.

### Todo
Here is a todo list of future features/improvements I would like to add to the application.
- [x] Better help menu
- [x] Better "payments" screen
- [x] Add login screen
- [ ] Command line colors

### Contributing
